I've been playing with image manipulation which I call "pixel simulation"</br>with Processing language for couple of years.</br>I searched for good sample image and one day I discovered this photo - a photo taken by Yousuf Karsh. </br>
In this website, I made 12 variations of processed image. </br>Well, please enjoy! </br>( TAP to zoom | SWIPE to navigate )

1.
Simulation of pixels on CRT monitors.

2.
Draw a continuous spiral and change thickness of the line </br>by the brightness of original image.

3.
Mapping each alphabet on the canvas by the brightness of original image.

4.
Drawing each module's bar by the brightness of original image.

5.
Scatter a lot of points on the canvas and link them by relative distances.

6.
Use a modular SVG image and change the size of module by the brightness.

7.
Put more points on the canvas & link them.

8.
Scribble on canvas randomly. </br>The thickness of the line is based on the brightness of original image.

9.
Triangle modules gives mosaic like patterns.

10.
Make modules as concentric circle - </br>each circle's thickness varies by the brightness of the original image.

11.
3 modules consist of: </br> two arcs with differenc colors and a half-rectangle.

12.
Made by a pyramid-like module. </br> Module's center point is decided by the brightness.
